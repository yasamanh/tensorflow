In contrast to the performance of older machine learning algorithms, the performance of deep learning algorithms scales with the amount of data they are trained on -- the more data, the better the model. Consequently, deep learning algorithms typically outperform traditional ones. These models also have the ability to automatically extract features from data in a process called [feature learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_learning). This ability eliminates the need for a priori knowledge of the data to construct features, which is particularly useful when dealing with complex data such as images.  \n",

    "### Initializing Weights and Biases\n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, we want to initialize our weights with random values to break symmetry between neurons in a hidden layer. Additionally, we want to choose small values to avoid the **gradient vanishing problem**, where the weighted sum of the inputs (plus a bias) fall on the flat portion of the sigmoid curve. What is the proper scale of the weights?  Most of our activation functions have their best response for inputs of $\\mathcal O(1)$.  If we have $m$ random inputs, each of $\\mathcal O(1)$, we expect their sum to scale as $\\sqrt m$.  Therefore, weights are often chosen randomly with a mean of zero and standard deviation of $1/\\sqrt m$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For very large layers, this gives rather small weights.  An alternative approach is to only provide $k < m$ non-zero weights when initializing neurons.  This scheme, known as **sparse initialization**, provides more diversity amongst the neurons at initialization.  It can, however, also produce very slow convergence as \"incorrect\" choices of non-zero weights have the be removed.\n",
